# Classification of Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms

Summary:
The data consists of 22 variables associated with several species of mushrooms. The target variable is binary (edible or poisonous) and the model aims to classify the mushrooms into these two classes. Feature importance rankings showed that Gill Color was significant in determining the class. The highest obtained train and test accuracy of the model was 100% (with all variables included), which is unlikely under realistic conditions. Possible reasons for the extremely high accuracy is becuase the data is highly hypothetical, very consistent (no missing values or errors) and limited. XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers were attempted as models.
